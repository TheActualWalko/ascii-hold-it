  <h4>Concept</h4>

  <p>For reasons that will be explained later, we<sup>1</sup> want to make you an avatar. A unique, memorable figure to represent you. The aesthetic in our minds sits on the balance of simplicity and sophistication, mystical and ultra-natural, vague enough for anyone to believe theirs genuinely represents them.</p>

  <p>Here's how.</p>

  <h4>Fish</h4>

  <p>In the beginning, we called them &lsquo;fish&rsquo;, since our original vision came from <a href="http://www.jenovachen.com/flowingames/flowing.htm">the classic aqueous Flash game <em>Flow</em></a>.</p>

  <p>As Flow shows us, an abundance of character and personality can be expressed using only lines and hollow circles, if they move right. It&rsquo;s also easy to tell a computer how to draw these things, and thus easy to play and experiment with the drawing process.</p>

    <figcaption>I think he likes you.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The way these beings are constructed is reasonably straightforward. We start with the notion of a branch.</p>

  <figure>
    <img data-asciiholdit="8" src="pics/basic-branch.png" alt="A basic branch: several circles connected in a straight line." />
    <figcaption>Branch!</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The basic branch is set of several circles in a straight line.</p>

  <p>Here&rsquo;s a more complicated one:</p>

  <figure>
    <img data-asciiholdit="8" src="pics/fractal-branch.png" alt="A more complex branch: some circles are replaced by symmetrical pairs of smaller branches!" />
    <figcaption>~Fancybranch~</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The nodes that make up the branch are not always circles - sometimes they&rsquo;re vertices that split off into a pair of symmetrical sub-branches roughly perpendicular to the root. These sub-branches follow the same definition as our &lsquo;root&rsquo; branch: they are a row of either circles or symmetrical pairs of smaller sub-sub-branches.</p>

  <p>With these rules, we can build a good variety of avatar-fish.</p>

  <figure>
    <img data-asciiholdit="8" src="pics/basic-fish-examples.png" alt="Several basic fish, constructed from relatively simple branches." />
    <figcaption>Fish = Branches = Avatars. In a blog post, anything is possible!</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>Genetic Variance</h4>

  <p>The hard part is variety. You don&rsquo;t get to design your avatar - the system chooses one for you. But yours has to stand out. It will ideally be yours alone.</p>

  <p>Starting with a mapping of human beings to natural numbers (Facebook and many first-world nations indirectly claim to achieve this), we are left with the task of finding a mapping of natural numbers to fish.</p>

  <figure>
    <img data-asciiholdit="8" src="pics/human-number-fish-diagram.png" alt="A visual depiction of the human-number-fish process." />
    <figcaption>This would have been much better without context.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    There are four values that describe an avafish<sup>2</sup> branch:
    <dl>
      <dt>numCells</dt>
      <dd>The number of circle/sub-branch nodes on the root branch.</dd>

      <dt>numBranches</dt>
      <dd>The number of cells on the root branch which will be sub-branches (instead of circles).</dd>

      <dt>cycle1 &amp; cycle2</dt>
      <dd>Two numbers which will dictate where the larger and smaller circles and sub-branches will be.</dd>
    </dl>
  </p>

  <p>To divine suitable values from our input number, and prevent any exact duplicates from existing, we mix in some irrational numbers with a dash of modular arithmetic.</p>

  <figure>
    <figcaption><strong>seed.ts</strong> (Typescript)</figcaption>
    <pre><code class="language-typescript">let seedFromNum = ( num : number ) : Seed =>{
  return {
    numCells    : Math.round( ( num % Math.PI ) ) + 4,
    numBranches : Math.round( ( num % Math.E ) ) + 1,
    cycle1      : num * 3 * Math.sqrt(3),
    cycle2      : num * 2 * Math.sqrt(2)
  };
};</code></pre>
  </figure>

  <p>It is of course common for two different numbers to yield the same values for numCells and numBranches, but collisions on all four values ought to be impossible.</p>

  <h4>Spawn</h4>

  <p>Once we have our seed values, we go about building the fish. The process is fairly straightforward:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Start with 100 energy.</li>
    <li>Build a simple branch (circles only) with the right number of cells.</li>
    <li>Choose energy for your cells (using <strong>cycle1</strong> &amp; <strong>cycle2</strong>) that add up to the amount of energy allocated for this branch.</li>
    <li>Convert the biggest cell into a pair of sub-branches, each with one-half the cell&rsquo;s energy, with <strong>numCells</strong> and <strong>numBranches</strong> in the same proportion as sub-branch energy to root-branch energy, and go to <strong>2</strong> to define them, until we have the right number of sub-branch cells.</li>
    <li>Draw the remaining cells as circles with radii determined by energy</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This is the result:</p>
